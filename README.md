# DSA Practice in JavaScript

This repository contains Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice problems implemented in JavaScript.

## Structure

- **Array/**: Array-related problems and solutions including search, insert, delete, merge, and maximum element problems
- **Queue/**: Queue implementation with enqueue and dequeue operations
- **Recursion/**: Recursion-based problems including factorial, head-tail recursion, and indirect recursion
- **Stack/**: Stack implementation with push and pop operations, including string reversal

## How to Run

Each problem has its own JavaScript file. You can run them using Node.js:

```bash
node Array/search.js
node Queue/enqueue.js
node Recursion/factorial.js
node Stack/push.js
```

Some problems also include HTML files for visualization in the browser.
